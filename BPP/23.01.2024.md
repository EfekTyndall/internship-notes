#### Location: ARENA2036

#### Handler: Torsten

#### Today Tasks:
1. Train Micropsi robot so it can go to further distance from the reference position
2. Introduction to FANUC CRX-10iA/L robot programming with Torsten
	- Setting up Tool Frame: Direct input method
	- Setting up different User Frame: Three point input method
	- Create one program to run on both user frames (blue box)
#### To Do:
1. Try to write the code cleaner and shorter using for loop (Still working on it)
2. Add documentation about [[The Tool Coordinate System (Tool Frame)]] and user frame
3. Add pictures to previous written documentation (FANUC & Micropsi)

#### Notes:
- After connecting the robot controller to the Mirai system, the robot controller need to be **"cold started"**, so it can be use fully in it's basic configuration. Somehow in the background, the Mirai system still changing some configuration to the robot, even though the Mirai system already being aborted on the FANUC teach pendant.
