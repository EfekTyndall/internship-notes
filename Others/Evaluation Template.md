### Tips for Use:

- **Customization**: Adjust the criteria based on your specific evaluation needs and the type of technology being assessed.
- **Scoring System**: Implement a scoring system for quantitative assessment, such as a scale from 1 to 10 for each criterion.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Use the template to compare multiple technologies side by side, which can be especially useful when making procurement decisions.
