# Tire Segmentation

Let us first discuss more details about the the task as hand. 
The task is to have a system that capable to recognize tire based on it's direction. 
This is indicated by the tires' pattern.
The input is an image, same as the image I gave you before.
The system should recognize the tire direction based on this image.
We already have labeled datasets.
The labels are left, right, no direction and fail.
With this labeled datasets, we want to first segment the tire on the image, which are relevant to us.
Other tires on the background should be ignored.
