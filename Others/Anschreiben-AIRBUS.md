Dear Hiring Manager,

As a Mechatronics student specializing in Robotics at Hochschule Darmstadt, I am thrilled at the opportunity to contribute to Airbus through the Bachelor thesis position in Robotics and Automation. The focus of the thesis on adapting and validating a collaborative robot for use in A330 fuselage assembly is an exciting challenge that I am eager to undertake.

My current role as an intern at Daimler Truck AG has equipped me with hands-on experience in programming an operating collaborative robots, including Fanuc and Universal Robots. This role involves significant collaboration in planning, setting up, and executing tests with robot systems. Key projects include setting up and programming an AI-controlled collaborative robot, commissioning and programming an automatic screwdriving robot for truck door assembly. These experiences have provided me with a robust foundation in both the practical and innovative applications of robotics in industrial settings.

I am currently scheduled to complete my internship in June 2024 and will be available to begin my thesis project with Airbus starting in July 2024. The opportunity to leverage my technical skills in the context of civil aircraft manufacturing, particularly through enhancing production capabilities in the A330 fuselage assembly, is incredibly exciting. I am drawn to your commitment to modern, varied technologies and the collaborative team environment. My background in programming, combined with extensive practical robotics applications and a thorough understanding of mechatronics principles, will allow me to effectively contribute to your team.

Furthermore, my proficiency in German and English is well-suited for the diverse and international work environment at Airbus. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join Airbus, where innovation is continuously pursued and team collaboration is encouraged.

I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing my application in more detail and am available for an interview. Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to potentially contribute to and learn from the esteemed team at Airbus.

Warm regards,

Martyn Devin Somba
