## Introduction

Visual positioning and tracking in 3D space is a critical component in various modern applications such as augmented reality (AR), robotics, and autonomous vehicles. These applications require accurate and efficient methods to ensure reliable performance. This bachelor thesis, titled "Benchmarking Visual Positioning and Tracking Methods of Moving Objects in 3D Space," aims to evaluate and compare different visual positioning and tracking methods specifically for moving objects. The research will support the integration of vision systems with robotic arms and provide a detailed analysis of each method's performance in an industrial environment.
