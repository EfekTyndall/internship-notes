# Semantic Vs Instance Segmentation

| Aspect           | Semantic Segmentation                                                                                                                                               | Instance Segmentation                                                                                                                                      |

| **Definition**      | Labels each pixel in an image with a class, but does not distinguish between different instances of the same class.                                                 | Labels each pixel in an image with a class and also differentiates between separate instances of the same class.                                           |
| **Differentiation** | Treats all instances of a class as a single entity.                                                                                                                 | Each instance of a class is uniquely identified.                                                                                                           |
| **Pros**            | Simplifies complex images by classifying areas, good for understanding the scene at a class level.                                                                  | Allows for detailed analysis, including counting, tracking, and distinguishing between individual objects.                                                 |
| **Cons**            | Cannot differentiate between individual objects of the same class, which limits its use in counting or tracking.                                                    | More computationally intensive and complex due to the added layer of instance differentiation.                                                              |
| **Example**         | In an aerial photo of a forest, all trees are labeled as 'tree' without distinguishing between each tree.                                                          | In the same aerial photo, each tree is individually distinguished and labeled, allowing for counting of the trees.                                        |
## Winner: Instance Segmentation!

**Reasons:** Instance segmentation will allow to distinguish the specific tire in the foreground from other tires and objects in the background.
