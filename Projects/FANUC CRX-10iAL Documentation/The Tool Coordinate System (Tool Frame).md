#### Introduction to the Tool Coordinate System

The tool coordinate system, or the **"Tool Frame"**, is crucial in robotics. It helps us control where and how a robot's tool moves and rotates in space. Imagine it as a guide that tells the robot's tool where to go and how to align itself.

#### Understanding the Basics

- **What is it?**: The tool coordinate system is a non-stationary, Cartesian system, which means it uses a grid made of right angles (like the squares on graph paper) for positioning.
- **Tool Center Point (TCP)**: This is the starting point, or 'zero point', of our coordinate system. It's located right at the heart of the tool.
- **Axes Orientation**:
    - **Z-Axis**: Generally points along the tool's direction. Think of it as pointing outwards from the tip of the tool.
    - **Default Position**: If not set up, it's at the front center of the tool flange (the part where the tool attaches to the robot), called the Tool Attachment Point (TAP). The Z-axis aligns with the robot's 6th axis.
    - **Standard Orientation**: The Z-axis typically points in a positive direction (away from the robot).

#### Position and Orientation

- **Coordinates**: We use six coordinates to describe the tool's position and orientation: x, y, z, w, p, r.
    - **x, y, z**: These describe the tool center point's position.
    - **w, p, r** (yaw, pitch, roll): These describe the tool's orientation by its rotations around the x, y, and z axes.
- **Flexibility**: You can adjust the position and orientation to fit different tools.
- **Multiple Systems**: Up to 10 different tool coordinate systems can be set (and this number can be changed in the robot's settings).

#### Advantages of Defining a Tool Center Point (TCP) on a Robot's Tool

 1. **Easy Orientation and Precision:** 
	 - With a TCP, the robot knows exactly where the pivot point of the tool is. 
	 - Makes manual operations simpler and more precise, as the robot can orient its tool accurately.
 2. **Consistent Speed in Movements:** 
	 - The speed at which the robot moves its tool is based on the TCP. This is important for tasks that require consistent speed. 
	 - It ensures that movements are smooth and consistent, directly benefiting the quality of tasks like gluing or welding.
 3. **Flexibility in Tool Switching:** 
	 - You can switch between different tools on the same robot by selecting the corresponding TCP for each tool. 
	 - This allows the robot to approach the same point using different tools, enhancing programming efficiency and versatility.
4. **Customizable Impact Direction:**
	- The direction in which the tool impacts or interacts with objects can be freely set.
	- Offers more control during manual operations, allowing for a wide range of tasks to be performed more effectively.

#### Calibrate a New Tool Frame

1. **Accessing the Tool Frames Menu:**
    - Navigate to **"MENU (Extend the Menu) > SETUP > Frames"** on the teach pendant.

    - If the screen doesn't display **"Tool Frame"**, press the **[OTHER]** button and select **"Tool Frame"**.

2. **Selecting a Tool Frame:**
    - In the **"Tool Frame"** section, pick a free entry from the list and press the **"DETAIL"** button. This allows you to enter the specifics of the new tool frame. For example, here we choose the entry number 9.

3. **Choosing the Calibration Method:**
	- Press the **[METHOD]** button to select a method for setting up the tool coordinate system.
	- **Direct Entry Method:**
	    - This method lets you manually enter the coordinates of the tool center point. It's useful if you already know these details from data sheets or CAD system measurements.
	    - After clicking **[METHOD]** button, select **"Direct Entry"**.

4. **Entering Coordinates and Orientation:**
	- In the **"Comment"** field, double-click on the line with asterisks to add a comment for your reference.
		![[TF_7.jpg|250]] ![[TF_8.jpg|250]]
	-  Use the arrow keys and numeric keypad to input the coordinates (X, Y, Z) and orientation (yaw, pitch, roll) of the tool.
		![[TF_9.jpg|250]]
	- **Note**: Measure the distance from the tool flange (Default Position) in X, Y, Z coordinate and the orientation. Distance is measured in millimeters and orientation in degrees.

#### Activating and Testing the Calibrated Tool Frame

Once you've successfully calibrated the tool coordinate system, it's important to activate and test it to confirm everything is set up correctly. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
1. **Accessing the Jog Menu:**
	- Hold the **"SHIFT"** key and press the **"COORD"** key simultaneously. This action will open the jog menu on your robot's interface.
2. **Activating the Tool Coordinate System:**
	- In the jog menu, navigate to the **"Tool"** option.
	- Enter the number of the tool coordinate system that you've just calibrated.
	- Confirm your selection by pressing **"ENTER"**.
	- The new tool coordinate system is now active.

3. **Testing the Tool Coordinate System:**
	- Select the **"TOOL"** coordinate system through the **"COORD"** option.
	- Rotate the tool around the x-, y-, or z-axis. As you do this, observe the movement and position of the tool center point closely.
	    - **What to Look For**: Ensure that the tool moves as expected and that the tool center point aligns correctly with your inputs.
	- Additional Testing (if applicable):
	    - If you used the **Direct Entry** or the **Six Point Method** for calibration, also verify that the axis directions are correct as per your specifications.

**Note on Observation**
- Pay attention to how the tool behaves as you rotate it. The movements should correspond accurately to the axis you are manipulating.
- If you notice any discrepancies or unexpected movements, you may need to recalibrate or adjust the settings.
