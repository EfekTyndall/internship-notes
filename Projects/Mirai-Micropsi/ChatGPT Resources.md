# Project Documentation: Implementation of Mirai Robot Control Technology with FANUC CRX-10iA/L Collaborative Robot

## Introduction to the Project

During my internship, a pivotal project I was involved in aimed to enhance the operational efficiency and adaptability of the assembly line by integrating Micropsi Industries' innovative Mirai robot control technology with a FANUC CRX-10iA/L collaborative robot. This project served as a practical application of my academic studies in mechatronics engineering, providing a hands-on experience in implementing cutting-edge automation solutions in a real-world industrial setting.

The project's objective was to leverage the Mirai technology's advanced capabilities to automate complex, dynamic tasks on the assembly line that require a high degree of precision and adaptability, surpassing the capabilities of traditional automation systems.

Initiated against the backdrop of an increasing need for flexible and intelligent automation in manufacturing, the project sought to explore the synergy between the advanced machine learning-driven control system of Mirai and the safety and efficiency of the FANUC CRX-10iA/L collaborative robot. This integration aimed to overcome the limitations of traditional robotic systems by introducing a more adaptable and intuitive automation solution.

The project involved setting up the Mirai control system with the collaborative robot to perform precision tasks, such as the accurate placement of components within the assembly process. Key activities included configuring the robot with the Mirai system, conducting hand-guided training sessions to "teach" the robot necessary tasks, and optimizing the system to adapt to real-time process variations. This integration showcased the potential of combining collaborative robotics with machine learning to revolutionize traditional manufacturing automation approaches.

## Objectives and Scope

The primary goal of integrating Mirai technology into our assembly processes was to automate complex motion sequences within dynamic environments, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of robotic operations. This initiative was not just about technological implementation; it was also an exploration into the innovative realm of machine learning-based robot control. Moving beyond the confines of traditional programming methods, the project embraced an intuitive, hand-guided training approach, marking a significant leap towards more intelligent automation solutions.

A key objective was to demonstrate the practical application of this technology through a specific use case: the precise manipulation of truck switches during the assembly process. This task, characterized by its demand for accuracy and adaptability, served as an ideal scenario to showcase the capabilities of Mirai technology in real-world manufacturing settings.

The scope of the project was carefully defined to focus on tasks that required advanced hand-eye coordination, leveraging the collaborative strengths of the FANUC robot in tandem with Mirai's machine learning prowess. The integration process encompassed the initial setup of the Mirai system, the execution of hand-guided training sessions to develop and refine "Mirai Skills," and the subsequent optimization of these skills to ensure their effective application in real-time assembly operations.

However, the project was also subject to certain limitations and constraints. The training phase, for instance, required a significant time investment to achieve the desired level of skill robustness. The precision of the tasks at hand posed another challenge, often necessitating multiple training sessions to attain the required accuracy. Technological limitations, such as the camera's field of view, imposed additional constraints on the project's scope, as did the need for continuous manual input during the training phase, particularly in terms of safety mechanisms like the dead man switch in T1 Mode. Furthermore, the optimal functionality of the system was contingent upon the integration of additional hardware components, such as force sensors, highlighting the complex interplay of various technological elements within the project.

In summary, the project to integrate Mirai technology with the FANUC CRX-10iA/L collaborative robot was defined by ambitious objectives aimed at advancing the frontiers of robotic automation. While navigating through the challenges and constraints inherent in such pioneering work, the project carved out a path toward redefining the capabilities and potential applications of collaborative robots in modern manufacturing environments.
