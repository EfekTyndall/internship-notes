The main objective of this project was to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the truck door assembly line. The approach involved implementing an automated screw driving system for assembling truck doors, utilizing robotic technology to boost productivity and assembly precision, minimize manual labor, and reallocate human resources to tasks requiring higher cognitive skills. This initiative was strategically designed to enhance production throughput and ensure consistent quality, focusing on optimizing quality control and operational efficiency.

# Operational Workflow

The system enhances efficiency through a dual-station setup. Initially, two assembly stations are established adjacent to the robot to secure truck door components for the screwing process. Operators position a door component at a station and initiate the screwing process with a straightforward control, facilitating seamless interaction between humans and the robot. Upon activation, the robot performs the screwing task with high precision and consistency. As the robot operates on one side, operators can prepare the subsequent component at the alternate station, ensuring an uninterrupted workflow. Once the robot concludes the screwing task, the assembled component is removed, and the cycle recommences with a new piece.

# Tool Coordinate System (Tool Frame) Calibration

Calibrating the Tool Coordinate System, or "Tool Frame," is crucial for robotic tasks demanding high precision, like screw driving or camera-assisted positioning. The Tool Frame is vital as it defines the interaction between the robot's tool and its environment, guaranteeing precise movements and operations.

This calibration establishes a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system centered on the Tool Center Point (TCP), which is essential for accurate tool positioning and orientation in relation to the robot. The TCP serves as a reference 'zero point,' ensuring the robot performs consistently in tasks requiring exact movements. By allowing for the adjustment and definition of multiple tool frames, this calibration not only enhances the robot's accuracy but also its adaptability, facilitating swift tool changes and the execution of various tasks.

## Calibration Technique: The "Three Point Method"

The "Three Point Method" is an effective strategy for tool frame calibration, particularly beneficial when the precise coordinates of the TCP (Tool Center Point) are not readily available. This approach is invaluable for configuring tool frames for various tools, including the screw driving spindle and camera, ensuring precise and consistent tool operation.

**Procedure**:

1. **Reference Point and Orientations**: The robot's tool is positioned at a single specific point, and it is adjusted to three distinct orientations. This singular point, along with its varied orientations, is used as the basis for ascertaining the exact location of the TCP.
2. **Focus on Orientation**: The determination of the TCP's orientation is emphasized, with the tool's position being kept static and aligned with the robot's architectural design.
3. **Necessary Equipment**: A stationary measuring device, preferably one that resembles a pinpoint target and is within the robot's operational range, is utilized. A measuring tip, indicative of the TCP, is attached to the tool. The extremity is used as the TCP for the spindle; for the camera, the TCP is positioned at the center of its viewing area.
4. **Determining TCP**: The robot is manually maneuvered to the designated point, and its position is recorded across three different orientations. Through this process, the TCP's three-dimensional coordinates are precisely established in relation to the robot's base.

**Calibration Using the Teach Pendant**:

- The Tool Frame settings are navigated to on the teach pendant via MENU > SETUP > Frames > [OTHER] > Tool Frame.
- An unused entry is selected (such as Tool Frame 3 for the spindle, Tool Frame 4 for the camera) and DETAIL is opted for.
- The Three Point Method is initiated by choosing [METHOD] > Three Point.
- The TCP is aligned with the tip of the measuring device at the initial point, and this position is saved by pressing SHIFT followed by RECORD.
- Similar steps are executed for the two subsequent points, with different orientations being ensured to accurately establish the TCP.

The key to this calibration process is the meticulous alignment of the TCP with the measuring device at each point, incorporating diverse orientations for enhanced precision. Once completed, the system automatically calculates and updates the tool's coordinate system, revealing the x, y, and z coordinates, confirming successful calibration.

# User Defined Coordinate System (User Frame) Calibration

Calibrating User Defined Coordinate Systems (User Frames) is essential for tailoring the robot's interaction within various segments of its operational environment. These frames adjust the robot's spatial reference points to suit particular tasks or workspace areas, enhancing its adaptability and efficiency.

User Frames modify the robot's spatial references, aligning its activities with specific areas or tasks within the workspace. The capability to set multiple User Frames increases the robot's versatility, facilitating seamless transitions between different tasks or tools. In the realm of programming, User Frames act as the baseline for all positional data, ensuring the robot's movements are consistent with the predefined workspace configuration. Moreover, User Frames enable swift recalibrations in response to alterations in the workspace, like moved fixtures, maintaining accuracy with the predefined frames.

For this initiative, establishing User Frames for both the left and right assembly stations is crucial to ensure precise synchronization with the work environment.

## Calibration Technique: The "Three Point Method"

The "Three Point Method" is also employed for calibrating User Frames, mirroring its application in Tool Frame settings. This approach determines the position and orientation of User Frames by identifying three reference points on each assembly station, providing a clear and precise spatial framework for the robot's operations in specific areas of the workspace.

**Procedure**:

1. **Reference Points Selection**: Three drilled holes on each assembly station are manually navigated to by the robot, acting as specific interpolation points.
2. **Documentation of Points**: The positions of these three drilled holes on the station are accurately documented using a measuring tip that corresponds to a calibrated Tool Frame.
3. **Computation of User Frame**: These points are processed by the robot's control system to determine the User Frame's orientation and location, aligning it with the base or 'WORLD' coordinate system.

**Configuring User Frames with the Teach Pendant**:

- The appropriate Tool Frame for the measuring tip, like Tool Frame 4 for the screw driving spindle, is activated.
- User Frame settings are accessed via the teach pendant by navigating through MENU > SETUP > Frames > [OTHER] > User Frame.
- An available slot for the new User Frame (such as User Frame 40 for the left station and User Frame 45 for the right station) is chosen, and DETAIL is selected.
- The Three Point Method calibration is initiated by selecting [METHOD] > Three Point.

**Documenting Interpolation Points**:

- **Orientation of Origin Point**: The User Frame's origin is established by the alignment of the robot's measuring tip with the selected origin point on the assembly station, and this position is recorded.
- **Point in X-Axis Direction**: The measuring tip is relocated to a point along the x-axis from the origin, and this position is documented.
- **Point in Y-Axis Direction**: The tip is moved from the origin or the robot's current position to a specified point along the y-axis, and this location is registered.

The initial "Origin Point Orientation" sets the zero point for the User Frame, with the following points specifying the positive directions along the x and y axes. This approach ensures the robot's operational area is precisely correlated with the actual layout of the assembly stations, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of its tasks.

# Point Teaching

After calibrating the tool and user frames, the next essential step is "Point Teaching." In this phase, precise instructions are given to the robot regarding crucial points for the screwing task on truck doors. This includes the exact locations of the screw holes, as well as strategically determined offset points to avoid potential collisions during the operation. Additionally, other vital points that support the screwing process are identified and taught to the robot.

## Steps in Point Teaching:

1. **Screw Holes Location**: The robot's screw driving spindle is manually positioned near each designated screw hole on the truck doors by an operator. At this initial phase, exact precision is not necessary; a rough alignment is adequate.
    
2. **Positions Documentation**: Once the spindle tip is positioned in alignment with a screw hole, this location is recorded in the robot's system as a "position register." These registers serve as digital landmarks, facilitating the programming of the robot by enabling swift navigation to these predetermined points via their respective registers.
    
3. **Offset Points Establishment**: Offset points are determined to enhance operational efficiency and safety. These points are strategically selected to guide the robot's movements, thereby avoiding any potential collisions with the truck doors or any part of the assembly station.
    
4. **Additional Points Specification**: Other essential points pertinent to the screwing process, like start positions, resting points, or particular operational routes, are determined, and the robot is instructed accordingly.


In the Point Teaching phase, the focus is not on the exact precision of the screw holes' locations since the ISRA Vision System later plays a vital role. This system dynamically detects and adjusts to the exact screw hole positions, allowing the robot to correct any discrepancies from the taught locations, ensuring accurate screw placement even with slight variations in door alignment or hole positioning.

It's important to note that the positions saved in the position registers are relative to the active tool and user frames. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure the correct frames are selected during this teaching process to maintain consistency and accuracy.

## Left Hand Side Door Points

For the left-hand side door, specific points are programmed using Tool Frame 4 (for the screw driving spindle) and User Frame 40 (pertaining to the left assembly station):

- **PR[11] - PR[18]**: These registers store the positions for screw locations on the left-hand door, with each register, from PR[11] to PR[18], dedicated to a distinct screw. These are labeled from Screw_11_LH to Screw_18_LH, aligning each position register with a specific screw location on the door.
    
- **PR[2] = Offset_Z_PR18lh**: This register, PR[2], is designated as an offset point to ensure adequate spatial clearance and prevent any potential collisions, especially in the area between screws 17 and 18 on the left-hand door.

## Right Hand Side Door Points
  
For the right-hand side door, points are defined using Tool Frame 4 (for the screw driving spindle) and User Frame 45 (for the right assembly station):

- **PR[21] - PR[28]**: These position registers, from PR[21] to PR[28], hold the locations for screw placements on the right-hand door. Each register corresponds to a specific screw, designated as Screw_11_RH to Screw_18_RH, aligning each position with a particular screw location on the door.
    
- **PR[1] = Offset_Z_PR18rh**: PR[1] is assigned as an offset point to provide the necessary clearance, ensuring smooth movement and avoiding any potential collisions between screws 17 and 18 on the right-hand side.

##Additional Points

- **PR[5] = calib_plate_1.1**: PR[5] is designated to mark the calibration plate's coordinate system at point 1.1. This specific point is recorded in relation to Tool Frame 4 and User Frame 0, which represents the world coordinate system.

# ISRA Vision System

The ISRA Vision System is crucial for dynamically pinpointing and adapting to the exact locations of screw holes. It operates by capturing an image before each screwing action to determine the distance from the Tool Center Point (TCP) to the hole. This integration of feedback from the vision system enables the robot to autonomously adjust for any deviations from the initially programmed positions, guaranteeing precise screw placement even with slight discrepancies in the positioning of the doors or the screw holes.

The camera, essential to the vision system, is mounted on the flange of the mounting plate adjacent to the spindle. For optimal performance, the camera undergoes calibration through the Assembly Control Node (ACN) using a photogrammetric approach. This involves taking images of a known pattern, with the camera identifying screwing points by recognizing the contours of the holes. The system then calculates the hole's position and communicates this information to the robot controller, either as an absolute position or relative to the TCP.

To ensure accurate recognition, the vision system is trained to identify the contours of each screw hole, with each hole's image and contours stored as a "Product" within the ISRA Vision System.

When the vision system relays position data to the robot controller, these coordinates are saved in a position register for use within the program. If the data represents a correction to the TCP, the robot is instructed to adjust to these coordinates as an offset from the predetermined position. During each screwing task, the robot first positions itself at the image acquisition point (established during point teaching), captures an image for about one second, and then adjusts its position based on the calculated x and y corrections relative to the tool's coordinate system. Following this adjustment, the robot proceeds to the new position and moves in the tool's positive Z-direction to commence screwing.
