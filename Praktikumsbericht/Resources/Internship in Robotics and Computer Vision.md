Internship in Robotics and Computer Vision starting December 2023

Welcome to Daimler Trucks and Buses!

We always strive to advance all those who keep the world moving. Transportation is the backbone of our economy and modern life. Without transportation, factories could no longer produce anything, supermarkets would have no products to sell and travel would be unimaginable for people. Our commitment to society and the environment determines our daily business. Our aim is to make the world cleaner, safer, more efficient and more comfortable through our actions. We firmly believe in the importance of highly innovative technology and are always aware of our social responsibility when developing our products.

Developments such as digitalization, autonomous driving and e-mobility represent a fundamental transformation of the transport sector that is constantly presenting new challenges. To ensure a successful future, we rely on close and trusting cooperation - both with our customers and with our globally active team of highly competent and motivated employees. Become part of our team, experience the fascination of our industry and actively contribute to the success of Daimler Trucks and Buses! As a central planning department at the Leinfelden site, we deal with new production technologies for the Daimler Trucks production sites worldwide. The focus here is particularly on intralogistics and assembly processes. As digitalization continues to advance and the transition to Industry 4.0 progresses, these areas of production are facing increasingly complex challenges. Increasing product variance and greater demands for flexibility and changeability require the use of new technologies from a wide range of disciplines such as robotics, artificial intelligence, computer vision and digitalization.

New and innovative methods, concepts and technologies enable a technological transformation process towards fluid production. In order to prepare this path, the Smart Automation team in Technology Management at Daimler Trucks is currently working on solutions for implementing mobile and cooperative robots for automated shopping basket formation and for supporting assembly activities. These systems are mainly being developed in collaboration with start-ups and partners from research and industry in the ARENA2036 research factory.

These are some of the challenges you will face:
- Collaboration in project management (preparation of management presentations, protocols) 
- Participation in technology and start-up screening and preparation of technical/economic comparisons (e.g. for providers of AI-based robot picking systems)
- Collaboration in the planning, setup and implementation of tests with robotic systems in the ARENA2036 research factory
- Setting up and programming robot demonstration applications (Universal Robots, FANUC)
- Creating test documentation and videos (e.g. with DaVinci Resolve)

Qualifications:
- Confident knowledge of German and English
- Very good handling of MS Office products
- Interest in I4.0 and robotics
- Programming skills (e.g. Python, ROS) desirable
- Previous experience in programming or operating robots (e.g. UR, FANUC, KUKA) desirable
- Commitment, independence and ability to work in a team
- Analytical mindset and strategic way of working
- Communication skills
- Technical understanding
- Quick comprehension
