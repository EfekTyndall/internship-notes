Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Bachelor thesis position within the Robotics and Automation department at Airbus, titled "Umbau und Validierung eines kollaborativen Roboters um eine Einführung in der A330-Flugzeugrumpfmontage zu ermöglichen." As a Mechatronics student specializing in Robotics at Hochschule Darmstadt, I am eager to contribute to Airbus’s pioneering projects, specifically in transforming robotic applications for aircraft assembly.

My current role as an intern in the Smart Automation Team at Daimler Truck AG has equipped me with hands-on experience in designing and programming collaborative robots, including Fanuc and Universal Robots. This role involves significant collaboration in planning, setting up, and executing tests with robot systems. Key projects include setting up and programming an AI-controlled collaborative robot, commissioning and programming an automatic screwdriving robot for truck door assembly, and supporting the evaluation of a bin-picking robot system based on machine learning. These experiences have provided me with a robust foundation in both the practical and innovative applications of robotics in industrial settings.

I am currently scheduled to complete my internship at Daimler Truck AG in June 2024 and will be available to begin my thesis project with Airbus starting in July 2024. The opportunity to leverage my technical skills in the context of civil aircraft manufacturing, particularly through enhancing production capabilities in the A330 fuselage assembly, is incredibly exciting. I am drawn to your commitment to modern, varied technologies and the collaborative team environment. My background in programming, combined with extensive practical robotics applications and a thorough understanding of mechatronics principles, will allow me to effectively contribute to your team.

Furthermore, my multilingual proficiency in German, English, and Indonesian is well-suited for the diverse and international work environment at Airbus. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join Airbus, where innovation is continuously pursued and team collaboration is encouraged.

Enclosed are my resume, relevant certificates, and enrollment verification as requested. I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing my application in more detail and am available for an interview at your earliest convenience. Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to potentially contribute to and learn from the esteemed team at Airbus.

Warm regards,

Martyn Devin Somba
