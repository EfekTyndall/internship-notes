## AC Robot

### Änderungen im Code

- TIMER[1] = LH/ RH Screwing Process Timer
- TIMER[5] = Main Program Timer
- TIMER[6] = Safe Move Check Home Program Timer
- TIMER[7] = Safe Move Check Left Program Timer
- TIMER[8] = Safe Move Check Right Program Timer
- All timers are reset in ISRA_CELL_INIT
- PR[91] = PILZ Messung Ausgangsposition für Screw 13 RH
- PR[92] = PILZ Messung Endposition für Screw 13 RH
- Fast Override R[4] changed to 100
- Slow Override R[5] changed to 10
- Force Limit Sensitivity = LOW
- External Force Limit = 80 N

### To DOs

- [x] Test robot functionality with the new force limit parameters, both on slow and high speed situation
- [x] Check cycle time for the process
- [x] Video recording planning

### Speed Test

**Speed Test 80N Limit, 10% Override or 50 mm/s:**
- LH:
	- From Home to pre-pos LH force exceeded limit 
	- From screw 12 to screw 13 force exceeded limit 
	- From screw 15 to screw 16 force exceeded limit 
	- From screw 18 to pre-pos
- RH:
	- From pre-pos to 11 force exceeded limit (just before reaching measuring position)
	- From screw 12 to screw 13 force exceeded limit (during collision avoidance motion)

**Speed Test 80N Limit, 100% Override or 500mm/s:**
- For both LH and RH not possible

### Cycle Time

**150N Limit, 10% Override or 50mm/s:**
- LH:
	- TIMER[1] = 231,34 s
	- TIMER[5] = 281,76 s
	- TIMER[6] = 25,75 s
	- TIMER[7] = 24,66 s
	- TIMER[8] = -
- RH:
	- TIMER[1] = 244,48 s
	- TIMER[5] = 294,47 s
	- TIMER[6] = 25,78 s
	- TIMER[7] = -
	- TIMER[8] = 24,21 s

**150N Limit, 100% Override or 500mm/s:**
- LH:
	- TIMER[1] = 70,82 s
	- TIMER[5] = 77,54 s
	- TIMER[6] = 3,39 s
	- TIMER[7] = 3,33 s
	- TIMER[8] = -
- RH:
	- TIMER[1] = 71,25 s
	- TIMER[5] = 77,57 s
	- TIMER[6] = 3,40 s
	- TIMER[7] = -
	- TIMER[8] = 2,92 s

### Video Recording Plan

**Important to Capture:**
- Turning motion from Home to pre-pos(LH/ RH) and the other way around
- Motion to measuring position (Tool 3)
- Measuring result on ISRA UI, both contour detection and measuring result
- Motion from measuring to screwing position
- The screw feeding process:
	- Screw sorting and aligning on the linear feeder
	- Delivery process from feeder to spindle
- Screwing process (spindle)
	- Especially screw 17 and 18
- Motion to avoid collision:
	- 12-13
	- 17-18
- Lever arm closing and opening motion

**Optional:**
- Werker quittieren Bestätigung

**Rough Plan:**
1. Show motion HOME -> pre-pos, with diagonal perspective
2. Show motion pre-pos -> screw 11 with diagonal perspective
3. Close up shot of screw 11 and/ or 12 using multiple perspective to focusing on:
	- Measuring
	- Screw delivery
	- Moving to screw driving position
	- Screw driving process
	- Perspective:
		1. Perspective 1: Diagonal View
		2. Perspective 2: Go Pro View
		3. Perspective 4: ACN View
4. Show motion screw 12 to 13 (collision avoidance)
2. Close up shot of screw 13, using multiple perspective to focus on:
	1. Contour detection result (image)
	2. Measuring result (coordinate)
3. Multiple perspective to show linear feeder process and the delivery process to spindle for the next screws.
4. Show motion from screw 16 -> 17, including:
	1. Movement of the lever closing
	2. Collision avoidance to avoid the closing lever
5. Show motion screw 17 -> 18 (collision avoidance)
6. Back to pre-pos and then home
